"""with_ImageHub.py -- demonstrate using ImageHub class in with statement

An ImageHub can be instantiated in a "with" statement. This will cause the
ImageHub to be closed after the completion of the with statment block.

1. Run this program in its own terminal window on the mac:
python with_ImageHub.py

This 'receive and display images' program must be running before starting
the RPi image sending program.

2. Run the image sending program on the RPi:
python with_ImageSender.py

A cv2.imshow() window will appear on the Mac showing the tramsmitted images
as a video stream. You can repeat Step 2 and start the with_ImageSender.py
on multiple RPis and each one will cause a new cv2.imshow() window to open.

To end the programs, press Ctrl-C in the terminal window of each program.
